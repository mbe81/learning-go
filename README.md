# Learning Go

Hi there! In this repository a store some simple code challenges to practise the Go language. Feel free to look into my code and do what you want with it. I just started learning Go so any feedback is welcome!

I came across the assignments on this blog post: https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/20-code-challenges/
